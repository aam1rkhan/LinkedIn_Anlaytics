# LinkedIn_Analytics
The project Scope discusses how we have scrapped and analyzed the data on the LinkedIn platform. we have tried to cover different insights including how jobs are distributed in the country India so including various aspects such as how jobs are available based on Different cities and how many different applicants are applying for that particular job apart from that we have also covered how many numbers of followers or what is the count of followers of that particular company so that based upon that data a person can decide whether he/she wants to work with a startup or Big MNCs

# Overview
In this project, we scrape job data from LinkedIn using Beautiful Soup and Selenium. The data is then analyzed using Power BI, incorporating DAX queries for deeper insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used
# Web Scraping
1) Beautiful Soup: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that are helpful for extracting data from HTML.
2) Selenium: A portable framework for testing web applications. It is also used for web scraping to interact with dynamic content.
3) 
# Visualization
Power BI: A business analytics tool by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.
DAX Queries: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a formula language used in Power BI to create custom calculations in calculated columns and measures.   

# Project Structure
